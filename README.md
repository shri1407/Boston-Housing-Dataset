# Boston-Housing-Dataset

The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).

**Features**
1.  `RM`: average number of rooms per dwelling
2. `LSTAT`: percentage of population considered lower status
3. `PTRATIO`: pupil-teacher ratio by town

**Target Variable**
4. `MEDV`: median value of owner-occupied homes

The objective is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available and then utilize this model to estimate the best selling price for the client's home. Additional information on the Boston Housing dataset can be found [`here`]
